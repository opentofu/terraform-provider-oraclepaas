# oraclepaas_java_service_instance

The `oraclepaas_java_service_instance` resource creates and manages an Oracle Java Cloud Service instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic.

## Example Usage

The following is an example of how to provision a service instance with on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure:

```hcl
resource "oraclepaas_java_service_instance" "jcs" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "Example Terraformed JCS with OCI DB"

  edition                = "EE"            
  service_version        = "12cRelease213"
  metering_frequency     = "HOURLY"
  bring_your_own_license = true

  ssh_public_key = "${file(var.ssh_public_key_file)}"

  # OCI Settings
  region              = "${var.region}"
  availability_domain = "${var.availability_domain}"
  subnet              = "${var.subnet.id}"

  weblogic_server {
    shape = "VM.Standard2.1"

    connect_string = "//${oci_database_db_system.database.hostname}-scan.${data.oci_core_subnet.subnet.subnet_domain_name}:1521/${oci_database_db_system.database.db_home.0.database.0.pdb_name}.${data.oci_core_subnet.subnet.subnet_domain_name}"

    database {
      username = "sys"
      password = "${oci_database_db_system.database.db_home.0.database.0.admin_password}"
    }

    admin {
      username = "weblogic"
      password = "Weblogic_1"
    }
  }

  backups {
    cloud_storage_container = "https://swiftobjectstorage.${var.region}.oraclecloud.com/v1/${var.tenancy}/${oci_objectstorage_bucket.backup.name}"
    cloud_storage_username  = "${var.storage_username}"
    cloud_storage_password  = "${var.storage_auth_token_token}"
  }
}
```

The following is an example of how to provision a service instance with an Database Cloud Service instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic :

```hcl
resource "oraclepaas_database_service_instance" "default" {
  ...
}

resource "oraclepaas_java_service_instance" "default" {
  name            = "java-service-instance"
  edition         = "EE"
  service_version = "12cRelease213"
  ssh_public_key  = "ssh-rsa public_key"

  weblogic_server {
    shape = "oc3"
    database {
      name     = "${oraclepaas_database_service_instance.test.name}"
      username = "sys"
      password = "Pa55_word"
    }
    admin {
      username = "weblogic"
      password = "Weblogic_1"
    }
  }

  backups {
    cloud_storage_container = "Storage-${var.domain}/java-service-instance-backup"
    auto_generate = true
  }
}
```
